### Data Set Summary & Exploration

#### A basic summary of the data set 

I used the pandas library to calculate summary statistics of the traffic
signs data set:

* The size of training set is 34799.
* The size of the validation set is 4410.
* The size of test set is 12630.
* The shape of a traffic sign image is 32x32.
* The number of unique classes/labels in the data set is 43.

#### Include an exploratory visualization of the dataset.

Here is an example of each of the sign.

### Design and Test a Model Architecture

#### 1. Describe how you preprocessed the image data. What techniques were chosen and why did you choose these techniques? Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc. (OPTIONAL: As described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric, if you generated additional data for training, describe why you decided to generate additional data, how you generated the data, and provide example images of the additional data. Then describe the characteristics of the augmented training set like number of images in the set, number of images for each class, etc.)

I didn't convert input data to grayscale because the color information is significant in differenciating the signs.

The preprocessing starts with per channel normalization which is making channel intensities centered around 0 and having unit standard deviation 
(mu = 0, stddev = 1). The mean and standard deviation is first computed from the training set. And then all the other data, including training data itself as well as testing and validation data are all transformed using the same mean and standard deviation.

Data augmentation proves to be a powerful technique to improve model accuracy. New data are generated by doing random brightness perturbation, followed by random scaling, translation and rotation. Below is an example of the original image and the augmented counterparts. In this particular setup, each training image is used to generate 3 more training examples.

#### 2. Describe what your final model architecture looks like including model type, layers, layer sizes, connectivity, etc.) Consider including a diagram and/or table describing the final model.

My final model consisted of the following layers:

| Layer         		|     Description	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| Input         		| 32x32x3 RGB image   							| 
| Convolution 1x1x3     | 1x1 stride, valid padding, outputs 32x32x3 	|
| Convolution 3x3x32    | 1x1 stride, valid padding, outputs 30x30x32 	|
| Convolution 3x3x32    | 1x1 stride, valid padding, outputs 28x28x32 	|
| RELU					|												|
| Max pooling	      	| 2x2 stride,  outputs 14x14x32 				|
| Convolution 3x3x64    | 1x1 stride, valid padding, outputs 12x12x64 	|
| Convolution 3x3x64    | 1x1 stride, valid padding, outputs 10x10x64 	|
| RELU					|												|
| Max pooling	      	| 2x2 stride,  outputs 5x5x64   				|
| Convolution 3x3x128   | 1x1 stride, valid padding, outputs 3x3x128 	|
| RELU					|												|
| Max pooling	      	| 3x3 stride,  outputs 1x1x128   				|
| Flatten       		| Concatenate all three pooling layers above, outputs (14x14x32 + 5x5x64 + 1x1x128 = 8000) |
| Fully connected		| width = 1024, dropout = 0.5        			|
| Fully connected		| width = 1024, dropout = 0.5       			|
| Fully connected		| width = 43       								|
| Softmax				| 43 logits        								|
 


#### 3. Describe how you trained your model. The discussion can include the type of optimizer, the batch size, number of epochs and any hyperparameters such as learning rate.

To train the model, I used average cross entropy of softmax of logits as the loss function. To minimize it, Adam optimizer is used.
Below is a list of parameters I used for training:

* learning rate = 0.001
* epochs = 15
* batch size = 64


#### 4. Describe the approach taken for finding a solution and getting the validation set accuracy to be at least 0.93. Include in the discussion the results on the training, validation and test sets and where in the code these were calculated. Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.

My final model results were:
* training set accuracy of *99.9%*
* validation set accuracy of *99.0%* 
* test set accuracy of *98.1%*

If an iterative approach was chosen:
* What was the first architecture that was tried and why was it chosen?

LeNet is used for the initial experiment which produce around 89% accuracy.

* What were some problems with the initial architecture?

The network is using grayscale which misses a lot of important information in the traffic sign appliation.
Also the number of convlutions layer are not enough to generalize the patterns in this application although it's a good fit for MNIST dataset 
considering the images pattern are not as complex as this one.
Given these limitations, I'm able to achieve 0.93 accuracy with grayscale inputs.

* How was the architecture adjusted and why was it adjusted? Typical adjustments could include choosing a different model architecture, adding or taking away layers (pooling, dropout, convolution, etc), using an activation function or changing the activation function. One common justification for adjusting an architecture would be due to overfitting or underfitting. A high accuracy on the training set but low accuracy on the validation set indicates over fitting; a low accuracy on both sets indicates under fitting.

To take color into account, we have to introduce a significant amount of parameters, so data augmentation needs to be done here. In particular, the first 
convolution layer learns an optimal color transformation that frees me from hand picking RGB, HSL, HSV and so on. 

* Which parameters were tuned? How were they adjusted and why?

I have experimented with different learning rate, batch size and number of epochs. The batch size of 64 gives the best performance. The learning rate from 
LeNet (0.001) and epochs (15) are performing well.


* What are some of the important design choices and why were they chosen? For example, why might a convolution layer work well with this problem? How might a dropout layer help with creating a successful model?

One important lesson from this is that the fully connected layer can take the output of each pooling layer to gather both the high level and low level  features. This greatly improves the accuracy. Also, more convolution layers and deeper number of filters help improve the accuracy, too.
Dropout layer is also important to prevent the network from overfitting, and easier to implement than regularization.

### Test a Model on New Images

#### 1. Choose five German traffic signs found on the web and provide them in the report. For each image, discuss what quality or qualities might be difficult to classify.

Here are five German traffic signs that I found on the web:

![alt text][image16] ![alt text][image17] ![alt text][image18] 
![alt text][image19] ![alt text][image20]

All the images should be realatively easier to classify because there are much more difficult cases in the training set.
Here is the cropped version:

#### 2. Discuss the model's predictions on these new traffic signs and compare the results to predicting on the test set. At a minimum, discuss what the predictions were, the accuracy on these new predictions, and compare the accuracy to the accuracy on the test set (OPTIONAL: Discuss the results in more detail as described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric).

Here are the results of the prediction:

| Image			        |     Prediction	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| Speed limit (80km/h)      		|    Speed limit (80km/h)									| 
| Ahead only     			| Ahead only 										|
| Roundabout mandatory					| Roundabout mandatory											|
| Stop	      		| Stop					 				|
| General caution			| General caution      							|


The model was able to correctly guess 5 of the 5 traffic signs, which gives an accuracy of 100%. This compares favorably to the accuracy on the test set of 98.1%.

#### 3. Describe how certain the model is when predicting on each of the five new images by looking at the softmax probabilities for each prediction. Provide the top 5 softmax probabilities for each image along with the sign type of each probability. (OPTIONAL: as described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric, visualizations can also be provided such as bar charts)

The code for making predictions on my final model is located in the 11th cell of the Ipython notebook.

For the first image, the model is relatively sure that this is a stop sign (probability of 0.6), and the image does contain a stop sign. The top five soft max probabilities were


| Probability         	|     Prediction	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| .60         			| Stop sign   									| 
| .20     				| U-turn 										|
| .05					| Yield											|
| .04	      			| Bumpy Road					 				|
| .01				    | Slippery Road      							|

Images below shows how confident the predictions are. As shown, the model is very confident on the predictions.

### (Optional) Visualizing the Neural Network (See Step 4 of the Ipython notebook for more details)
#### 1. Discuss the visual output of your trained network's feature maps. What characteristics did the neural network use to make classifications?
